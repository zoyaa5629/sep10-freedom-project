| Melody |  I love how you added your tool in your website it really brings out your topic. | I think it might be better if you changed the text color or size of your overview because it will be easier to read
| Cammi  | I like your fixed navbar, as well as your responsive cards as the screen size gets smaller  | I think you should fix your navbar content for "A-frame" because it is not working.
