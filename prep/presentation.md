# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* I will ask a question or open with a fact about fashion.
Example:

* The global fashion tech markeet is expected to be worth $130 billion dollars by 2030.
* From Iron Man’s smart suit to self-lacing sneakers in Back to the Future, fashion tech has always been a sci-fi dream.

## Product
*  I will make a yellkey of the website if anyone wants to look at it and I will include GIFs of the website.

## Process
* I will show code snippets and screenshots of the challenges I faced while coding and complex code that I struggled with.

## Conclusion
* I will give a couple takeaways such as learning how to priortize the content over visuals first and trying my best to achieve what I envisioned because there were a lot of times where I would almost give up adding something specific to my website.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
