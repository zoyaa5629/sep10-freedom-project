# Entry 1: Discovering More About Fashion
##### 10/7/24

## CHOOSING A TOPIC

The topic I decided one is Fashion. I chose this topic because it is something I am very intereseted in. I once wanted to work as a fashion designer and would watch videos and movies about fashion a lot. I loved and still do love movies that are famous for fashion like "The Devil Wears Prada". When I was a little girl I would also watch cartoons also famous for its fashion like "Monster High" which has helped me love every single fashion style. 

## Past Topics

My past topics were Cosmetics and International affairs because I love makeup even though I don't wear much and I love International Affairs like the United Nations and even wanted to become a diplomat once. The decision to choose between Fashion, Cosmetics, and International Affairs was a hard choice but I settled for Fashion knowing it would be something that I will be happy to write about throughout the year.
