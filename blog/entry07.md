# Entry 7
##### 5/15/25

## Context 
This past year we have been working on our freedom project and now we finally got to showcase our project at the expo. There were judges who looked around and graded peoples projects an d presentations. 

## Expo Takeaways
For me the expo went really well. I was confident in my presenting especially after getting feedback for my elevator pitch from Mr. Mueller. My website worked well and my presenting skills were good at the expo. I got honorable mention which made me feel happy and proud of myself. The expo really helped with my preesenting and people skills. I learned how to be more engaging and even though this isn't the first time I have participated in an expo I have learned much more from this SEP expo. 

## In Class Presentation
Before we went to the expo we had to do in class presentations. I was one of the first people to go up and I presented slides with code and challenges and takeaways of making my website. I wish I has time to put in a link to my website to give people a demo and according to feedback from Mr. Mueller I should have talked louder due to the a/c being on. Overall I think I did better in the Expo because it was shorter and to a small amount of people. I learned much more from the expo than the in class presentation because I always do in class presentations.
