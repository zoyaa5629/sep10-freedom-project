### Context
Earlier, we has focused on finding a topic and I had settled on fashion. This time we are doing more research into the technology of our topic and I did more research on fashion and the technological impacts on it. When researching the technology of fashion I had gone into the different types of hardware and software in the fashion industry. 

### Hardware
Below is a list of all the hardware technology uses I could find in the Fashion industry. Hopefully towards the future technology will be more of used in the fashion world.

* **3D Printing**

*3D printing has started to make its way to high end fashion. It has been in NYFW (New York Fashion Week), PFW (Paris Fashion Week), and the Met Gala.*

* **Robotics and Automation**
  
*Robotics and automation are optimising the fashion industry by streamlining various manufacturing processes and reducing human labour dependency. Your fashion brand can utilise robots and automation in production via sewing activities, fabric inspection, spreading and cutting, warehousing and even distribution. This technological integration offers you higher production rates, improved product quality and enhanced cost efficiency.*

* **Sewing Machine**
  
*The history of the sewing machine wouldn’t exist without the artistry of hand sewing. People started sewing by hand some 20,000 years ago, where the first needles were made from bones or animal horns and the thread made from animal sinew. Our inventive instinct explains the natural progression to want to improve sewing techniques and make it less laborious. Cue the Industrial Revolution in the 18th Century Europe, where the need to decrease manual sewing in factories became paramount.*

* **Drawing Tablet**
  
*A drawing tablet, also known as a graphics tablet, is a device consisting of a tablet, or a surface, that is sensitive to the pressure of a stylus. Paired with a stylus as a drawing tool, users draw on the tablet as if drawing on paper, as the image is shown on a computer screen.*

* **Textile Mills**
  
*Textile mills in the 1800s were either water or steam-powered. This energy was used to quickly and efficiently turn cotton into thread for weaving and to quickly weave thread into fabric or textiles. The invention of John Kay's flying shuttle and Richard Arkwright's water-powered spinning machine allowed for the mass production of textile goods.*

### Software
Below is a lift of a couple software technology uses in fashion. SOftware technoly in the fashion world is taking the world by storm to the point people only shop for clothes and accessories online. It is a billion dollar market that loads of desginers now use.  

* **Net-A-Porter.**
   
*Online luxury retailer Net-A-Porter is home to a deluge of major designer labels including Loewe, The Row and Bottega Veneta to name a few. Its 'New In' section on its app is brilliant at keeping you updated with all the hottest new pieces, with fresh arrivals now dropping five days a week.* 

* **Vestiaire Collective**
  
*Lauded by fashion insiders, Vestiaire Collective is excellent if you're wanting to get your hands on some pre-loved luxury pieces at a reasonable price point. It takes some of the anxiety out of shopping second-hand with its authentication procedures, and its vintage accessory collection is nothing short of lust-worthy.*

* **By Rotation**
  
*Another killer rental app, By Rotation is home to over 100,000 designer items and is committed to encouraging a consumer shift towards more sustainable practices with its groundbreaking peer-to-peer model. Plus, if you're looking to streamline your wardrobe, it even has the option of re-selling.*

* **Stylebook**
  
*If you're one to plan your outfits ahead of time then Stylebook will change your life. This app basically lets you virtually organise your wardrobe, create outfits and discover potential style options, all from the comfort of your handheld.*

* **The RealReal**
  
*Want to shop or sell preloved luxury? The RealReal is the world’s largest marketplace for authenticated luxury reselling. If you love archival designer pieces then scrolling through this app will be your next biggest hobby.*

* **Good On You**
  
*Sniffing out greenwashing is the name of the game for Good On You. Wanting to check how your favourite label stacks up from a sustainable and ethical standpoint? The app rates clothing brands according to its easy-to-understand rating system so that you can vote with your wallet.*

* **Depop**
  
*Preloved shopping destination Depop is an indispensable app for the Y2K devotee. From Noughties denim to Nineties pencil skirts, the e-commerce platform is super easy to navigate. You may not get as good a deal as on Vinted, but there are swathes of verified sellers to peruse.*

* **Vinted**
  
*Pre-loved obsessives will already no doubt be well versed in the joys of Vinted. Considerably less glamorous than the likes of Vestiaire, rest assured, the quick-and-easy offer feature means that app is positively brimming with potential bargains.*

* **VITE**
  
*Vite is London's newest same-day delivery, sustainable fashion destination. Great for when you need something to wear ASAP but don't want to compromise on quality, Vite will have your chosen outfit, accessory or both delivered to your door before the clock strikes 5 o'clock.*
