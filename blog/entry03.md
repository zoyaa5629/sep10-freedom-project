## Context
Previously, we had researched our topic and what hardware and software inventions existed in it. This time we researched and brainstormed inventions that don't already exist in our topic but would like to add. My topic was fashion and I had brainstormed many different inventions for fashion. I looked at tv shows and movies for inspiration because there are a lot of fashion inventions you can find in films but nobody has really invented it. Since my topic is fashion and I love fashion I used my imagination as well and things I've dreamt of as a kid. It was easy finalizing all my content because of how many interesting inventions there were for fashion. 

## Skills
While brainstroming inventions for Fashion I used collaboration and communication. I worked with the people around me to help me come up with ideas and I helped them come up with inventions for their topics such as graphic design and film making. These skill sets helped me with my list of inventions and I feel like I helped my peers as well. 

## Sources
My sources came from movies and films and my imagination. 

## Engineering Design Process
In my Engineering Design Process I am currently planning for my webpage. I've done my brainstorming and now I must plan on how to put it in my final webpage.
